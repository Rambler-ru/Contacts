# !!! Call "chmod +x mac_*"
# First install latest Qt4 for Mac OS X with Cocoa (Carbon version of Qt is NOT supported)
# minimum Qt version is Qt 4.7.0, but 4.8.x is preferred
# Second. Download Growl SDK and Sparkle, copy (with symlinks) Growl.framework and Sparkle.framework to /Library/Frameworks/
# Then call this:

qmake virtus.pro -r -spec macx-g++ CONFIG+=release CONFIG-=debug CONFIG-=debug_and_release DEFINES+=USE_PHONON
make -w
make install

# then copy needed frameworks:

./mac_cp_frameworks

# now preparing to release:

./mac_prepare_to_release

# after that you can create a .dmg file using disk utility (about 130-140 Mb needed, but after compression .dmg should be about 41-42 Mb)
